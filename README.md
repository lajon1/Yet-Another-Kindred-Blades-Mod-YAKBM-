## DESCRIPTION:
Yet Another Kindred Blades Mod (YAKBM) is another mod that tries to resemble some skins from PoP T2T before it was released.
This mod offers outfit customization. It's made in a way that the Prince's look is somewhat lore-accurate with 
the initial trailers and screenshots that were shared before the game's release.

## Sooo... What's changed?
-    Logo in the main menu
-    Reworked HUD similar to the one from WW
-    New customizable 1st outfit (the outfit that the Prince wears before getting the second dagger)
-    New customizable 2nd outfit (the outfit that the Prince wears after getting the second dagger)
-    New customizable 3rd outfit (the outfit that the Prince wears after reaching the sewers)
-    Face from WW
-    Scar on face from WW
-    Hair from WW (just the texture; the length is not changed)
-    Tattoo on the left arm from WW
-    Glowing WW tattoo (mostly)
-    Recolored daggers
-    New dagger
-    New intro videos

The outfits are consistent, meaning that after getting the 2nd and 3rd outfits, it still makes sense how they look.
They are not completely different outfits that came out of nowhere.

The Dark Prince remains the same, his look isn't changed by this mod!

## INSTALLATION:
1. Install the [20th Anniversary Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/princeofpersiathetwothrones/mods/12) for T2T.
2. Paste all contents of the Replacements directory into
C:\Users\user\Documents\Games\Prince of Persia\The Two Thrones\textures\VOKSI\Replacements
and overwrite them.
3. Paste the Video folder into the game's main directory. For the correct video scaling you might need to install 
the [Unofficial Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/princeofpersiathetwothrones/mods/10) and paste the patch.ini file 
from BONUS folder into the game's main directory.
4. (Optional) Customize the outfits however you want using the contents from the remaining directories.
The process is the same as in step 2, just paste and overwrite the files.

The default outfits used by files from Replacements directory: cape, no scarf, WW trousers, WW tattoo, WW belt, WW shoes,
WW armor

## BONUS:
1. Install [ReShade](https://reshade.me) (I used version 6.1.0) and paste the included preset file from the BONUS directory
into the game's main directory and overwrite it.

## BONUS 2:
1. Install the [Unofficial Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/princeofpersiathetwothrones/mods/10) for T2T (don't use bf file).
2. Paste the included patch.dll file from the BONUS directory into the game's main directory and overwrite it.

Kudos to borisskyman for the 20th Anniversary Mod, creators from Kindred Blades VK group and chessbase50 for 
making and uploading their KB mod with the included patch.dll + other assets.
Without their mods, I wouldn't have been able to create mine.
Kudos also to u/International_Pop914 for his advices and provided reference materials.
